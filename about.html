    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
    <p><i>"There must be more than this."</i></p>
    <p>This was the sentence that kept on coming up after each party. We have thought long and hard about party-goers to place white tables and lay the basis of the party. Company parties, birthdays, weddings, you name it.</p>
    <p>This was the starting point of <strong>PARTY IT UP</strong>. A great urge to <strong>personalise events</strong> as much as possible. Away from all the garlands that have been lying in the attic for years. We believe that every event deserves the right <strong>attention</strong> , RIGHT because there is something to celebrate.</p>
    <p>In the world it is always "do the normal or you're crazy". WAKE UP, in 2018 you can shine! After gaining inspiration in Austria, we saw that there really are ALL events on trend. From <strong>baby showers</strong>, <strong>children's parties</strong>, <strong>birthdays</strong>,  <strong>bachelor parties</strong>, <strong>weddings</strong> to <strong>business parties</strong> such as launches or openings are celebrated extensively. It must not be boring and certainly not standard.</p>
    <p>For our work we have often organized events and this was the ultimate enjoyment. We believe that each party should look AWESOME <strong>from A to Z</strong>. Whether you are organising a company party for 30 employees or planning a wedding for 150 guests. Your event has to offer the </strong>best experience</strong> and preferably your party goes <strong>viral</strong> on social media .</p>
    <p>For the nice and cool companies among us, we are ready to realize your ultimate dream event.</p>
    <p><strong>Let's make your event memorable & shareable!</strong></p>
